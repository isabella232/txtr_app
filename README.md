The default JSON used in the manifest is shown below:
`{
  "shared": {
    "tks": "thanks",
    "ta": "thanks",
    "zd": "Zendesk"
  },
  "3616907518": {
    "cu": "custom"
  }
}`

For the `zat validate` to pass it needs to be in one line.
"{\"shared\": {\"tks\": \"thanks\",\"ta\": \"thanks\",\"zd\": \"Zendesk\"},\"3616907518\": {\"cu\": \"custom\"}}"
